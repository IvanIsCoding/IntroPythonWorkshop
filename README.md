# Intro to Python Workshop ![Python 3.5+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.5+-blue.svg)

The attached code was created for the Introduction to Python Workshop run by the Quantitative Sciences Course Union at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.
For more information: visit the QSCU website(http://qscu.org/)

## Quickstart

For this workshop, we recommend to use Python in the console or in a Jupyter notebook. It is as simple as running the command:

```bash
python3
```

For running a Python file such as the test files we wrote, you just need to add the file name to the Python command:

```bash
python3 test_qscu.py
```

## File structure

The structure of the code given in the workshop is as follows:

    .
    ├── qscu.py                   # The class that represents the shop and accesses a SQLite database 
    ├── test_add.py               # The hello world of unit testing, testing the add function
    ├── test_qscu.py              # The tests for the qscu.py file we wrote during the workshop
